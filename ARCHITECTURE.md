# System Architecture

## Overview

The ML Trading System is built with a modular, pipeline-based architecture that separates concerns into distinct components while maintaining flexibility and extensibility. This document describes the system's architecture, components, and their interactions.

- Implements position sizing logic
- Manages entry/exit rules
- Handles signal filtering and validation

### 5. Risk Management (`utils/risk_management.py`)
- Implements position sizing
- Manages stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Handles portfolio risk constraints
- Provides drawdown protection

### 6. Performance Monitoring (`utils/monitoring.py`)
- Tracks model performance metrics
- Monitors feature drift
- Generates performance reports
- Handles alerting and notifications
